# Costa Rica HPC School 2022

This repository presents the source codes used in the course of Costa Rica High Performance Computing School 2002: sequential, MPI and Hybrid MPI+OpenMP. We have also the copies of the slides used during the classes. Additionally we present a support text for the preparation of the MPI execution environment, as well as running an MPI and Hybrid MPI program on some Posix operating system distributions.

The book used as reference can be found at <https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-programacao-paralela>.
